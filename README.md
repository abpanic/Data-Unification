# SQL-Data-Migration
Data migration solution using SSIS &amp; SQL Server for migrating data, incl. data ingestion, transformation &amp; loading using SSIS packages &amp; SQL scripts. Docs include data mapping, ETL process &amp; validation rules.

## To create a data pipeline to import data from MySQL to MS SQL Server with more than 1 million records while it is being used, you can follow these steps:

Install SSIS: Install SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) on your machine if it is not already installed. You can download and install SSIS from the SQL Server installation wizard or from the Microsoft Download Center.

Create a new SSIS project: Open SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) and create a new SSIS project by selecting "Integration Services Project" under the "New Project" dialog box.

Add a data flow task: Add a Data Flow Task to the Control Flow tab of your SSIS package by dragging and dropping it from the Toolbox.

Configure the data source: Add a MySQL data source to the Data Flow tab by dragging and dropping the "ADO.NET Source" component from the Toolbox onto the design surface. Double-click the component to open its editor, and configure the connection manager to connect to your MySQL database.

Configure the destination: Add a destination to the Data Flow tab by dragging and dropping the "OLE DB Destination" component from the Toolbox onto the design surface. Double-click the component to open its editor, and configure the connection manager to connect to your MS SQL Server database.

Map the columns: Map the columns between the source and destination components by dragging and dropping them from the source to the destination. Ensure that the column types match between the source and destination components.

Configure the data transformation: If you need to transform the data, add a data transformation component to the Data Flow tab, such as "Derived Column" or "Conditional Split". Configure the component to transform the data as needed.

Add error handling: Add error handling components to the Data Flow tab to handle any errors that occur during the import process. Examples of error handling components include "Row Count", "Conditional Split", and "Derived Column".

Test the SSIS package: Test the SSIS package by running it on a small sample dataset to ensure that it works as expected. Monitor the package performance to identify any bottlenecks or performance issues.

Schedule the SSIS package: Schedule the SSIS package to run at regular intervals, such as daily or weekly, to keep the MS SQL Server database up-to-date with the MySQL database. Use SQL Server Agent to schedule the package.

Monitor the SSIS package: Monitor the SSIS package to ensure that it runs smoothly and without errors. Use logging and alerts to track any issues and address them quickly.

Optimize the SSIS package: Optimize the SSIS package by identifying and addressing any performance bottlenecks. Consider using data compression, partitioning, or indexing to improve performance.

Secure the SSIS package: Secure the SSIS package by encrypting the data in transit and at rest, restricting access to the package, and auditing the package activity.

By following these steps, you can use SSIS to create a reliable and efficient data pipeline to import data from MySQL to MS SQL Server.


## to import data from Excel into SQL Server. Here are the steps:

Create a new SSIS package: Open SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) and create a new SSIS project by selecting "Integration Services Project" under the "New Project" dialog box.

Add a data flow task: Add a Data Flow Task to the Control Flow tab of your SSIS package by dragging and dropping it from the Toolbox.

Add an Excel source: Add an Excel data source to the Data Flow tab by dragging and dropping the "Excel Source" component from the Toolbox onto the design surface. Double-click the component to open its editor, and configure the connection manager to connect to your Excel file.

Add a destination: Add a destination to the Data Flow tab by dragging and dropping the "OLE DB Destination" component from the Toolbox onto the design surface. Double-click the component to open its editor, and configure the connection manager to connect to your SQL Server database.

Map the columns: Map the columns between the source and destination components by dragging and dropping them from the source to the destination. Ensure that the column types match between the source and destination components.
